# McLaren Racing Coding Exercise

Imagine you are provided a file containing a collection of requests to book a particular meeting room; each entry in the file specifies the start time and end time of a meeting. 
We would like you to write a small application that imports the contents of the file and detects whether or not any of the requested bookings conflict.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.6.4 was used alongside the Pandas, OS and uniitest libraries to develop this solution.


## Assumptions

A number of assumptions were made when developing this solution.

1. The booking data in the file is related to  only meeting room.
2. The file was in CSV format.
3. The data format is in csv format


4. ASSUMED THAT BOOK REQUESTS ARE IN ORDER


## Running the script

### Break down into end to end tests

The script can be ran using the following command.

```
python3 check_bookings.py
```

## Questions
what time standard?
is there a format for the room booking files?
test the file?
what file format?
script or oop?

Django tests

 To run

 python3 check_bookings.py
